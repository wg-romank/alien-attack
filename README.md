# WIP: alien attack arcate style game

This is a tech test / demo for working with WegbGL from Elm.
Game is hosted as static page at the url in the barcode.

## TODOS
- [x] Enemy spawn
- [x] Arcadish controls (sort of: added inertia)
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Taptic feedback
- [x] Layout that does not suck (still sucks on mobile)
- [x] Scrolling background ?
